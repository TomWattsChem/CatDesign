# CatalystDesign
A computer aided workflow for catalyst design.

This workflow can computationally calculate properties for hydrogen-bonding catalysts. For each catalyst a number of maximum 46 descriptors are calculated and then given as an input to a machine learning (ML) model. The aim is to use the knowledge gained from this analysis to predict the reactivity of new catalysts. The code is written in Python 3. MatLab is used for the ML analysis.
